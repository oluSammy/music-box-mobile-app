/**
 *
 * Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.

factorialize(5) should return a number.

Passed
factorialize(5) should return 120.

Passed
factorialize(10) should return 3628800.

Passed
factorialize(20) should return 2432902008176640000.

Passed
factorialize(0) should return 1
